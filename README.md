### Machine-Learning-Problem

#### Problem:

A school is trying to decide if they can use a writing test to understand which students may need to work on their motor skills at a young age. They are testing this by having them write numbers and they want us to build a model to see if we can predict what they’ve drawn. To accomplish this, they want you to use a simplistic approach (KNN) to start the research but also compare the results with something more complicated like neural networks to accomplish this week’s task. In theory, if the model can clearly identify what a number is, that may help us point out students that need more help.

##### Part 1:

Building a KNN model to predict handwriting correctly. (Testing out at least two values of K)

##### Part 2:

Building a Random Forest model to predict handwriting. Using at least two values of trees.

##### Part 3:

Building a neural network model to predict handwriting. Using at least two different activation functions.

##### Part 3:

Using multiple benchmarking metrics to compare and contrast the models built. Lastly summarizing them and giving out recommendation
